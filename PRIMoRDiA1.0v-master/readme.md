# What is PRIMoRDiA?

PRIMoRDiA ( PRIMoRDiA Macromolecular Reactivity
Descriptors Access ) is a shared memory parallel software
written in C++ for post electronic structure calculations, that
efficiently reads output files from most used quantum mechanics packages, storing molecular information and processing
it to generate several descriptors to evaluate the global and
local reactivity of molecular systems. PRIMoRDiA supports
the main reactivity descriptors of the Conceptual Density
Functional Theory, the most famous and used reactivity theory, which works from response variables of the electronic
structure of the molecules, as also other electrostatics properties.

Installation instructions and tutorials are in our [wiki](https://github.com/igorChem/PRIMoRDiA1.0v/wiki)
All theoretical background and working instructions of our program are in our userguide pdf file that can be found in this repository.
